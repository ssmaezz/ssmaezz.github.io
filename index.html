								<h2>Theremin (With Engineering House)  </br>January 2016 - May 2016</h2>
								<p>The controller's hand acts as the grounded plate of a variable capacitor in an L-C (inductance-capacitance) circuit, which is part of the oscillator and determines its frequency. Two antennas one controlling pitch, and the other controlling volume are directly coupled to the tuned circuit of the oscillator and the 'pitch field' which is output through a loudspeaker.</p>

								<h2>Rubins Tube (With Engineering House) </br>January 2016 - May 2016</h2>
								<p>A length of pipe is perforated along the top and sealed at both ends - one seal is attached to a small speaker or frequency generator, the other to a supply of a flammable gas (propane tank). The pipe is filled with the gas, and the gas leaking from the perforations is lit. If a suitable constant frequency is used, a standing wave can form within the tube. When the speaker is turned on, the standing wave will create points with oscillating (higher and lower) pressure and points with constant pressure (pressure nodes) along the tube. Where there is oscillating pressure due to the sound waves, less gas will escape from the perforations in the tube, and the flames will be lower at those points. At the pressure nodes, the flames are higher. At the end of the tube gas molecule velocity is zero and oscillating pressure is maximal, thus low flames are observed. It is possible to determine the wavelength from the flame minimum and maximum by measuring with a ruler.</p>

								<h2>Greenhouse in the community Garden (With ESW) </br>January 2016 - December 2016</h2>
								<p>​The 8’x12’ greenhouse is supported mainly by cattle panels - medium-thick wired fencing that can be bent into an oblong structure. The rest of the frame is weather-treated wood, and stakes for extra security against high winds. The plastic cover is UV-stabilized polyethylene, which should last four years (compared to standard polyethylene, which lasts up to one year). The structure houses two planting beds, a table for temperature data collection and seedling storage, and straw bales that will be turned into compost. They will produce heat as they decompose. Dr. Dawn Carter, who will be using the greenhouse as an educational piece in one of her classes and several other professors from different departments have been interested in learning about the greenhouse as well.</p>

								<h2>Savonius Wind turbine (With ESW) </br>August 2015 to May 2016</h2>
								<p>Utilized a 55 gallon drum to construct a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT)  to display at Imagine RIT. The project placed a heavy emphasis on community education. The goal was to quantitatively show wind power as a feasible option for RIT. The final goal is to have RIT conduct an official cost-benefit analysis and work towards installing multiple functioning wind turbines on campus.The wind turbine was destroyed by a wind storm in summer 2018.</p>

								<h2>Property Management</h2>
								<p>In January 2018, I made the decision to use my life savings to purchase a 5 bedroom home in Henrietta, NY. Since then, I have been renting out four of the bedrooms to friends to pay for the mortgage payments and utilities, effectively eliminating my own housing costs for the rest of my time in college. It took some convincing to get my parents on board, I had to prove to them that financially, this was an intelligent decision, one that would be worth the trouble in the long run. 

								Many maintenance and improvement projects have been completed to date. With the help of my roommates, I’ve installed a garbage disposal, run Ethernet, put in numerous plumbing shutoff valves and light switches, lived through 2-weeks without hot water in January while fighting with the insurance, remodeled the kitchen, one bathroom, fixed the rain gutters, replaced the dryer vent, and demolished the drywall in the basement to fix a mold problem. I’ve learned so many things about owning a home, and unforeseen costs that come from living in an older, not previously well maintained home. </p>
